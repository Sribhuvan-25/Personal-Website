# Project Introduction

This project is a web application designed to provide users with a seamless experience for managing their tasks. It is built using a microservices architecture, with each service designed to perform a specific function.

# Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each with a specific purpose:

- `/src`: This directory contains the source code of the application. It is further divided into subdirectories for each microservice.

- `/tests`: This directory contains all the test files and related resources.

- `/docs`: This directory contains all the documentation related to the project.

- `/config`: This directory contains configuration files for different environments (development, testing, production).

- `/scripts`: This directory contains scripts for various tasks such as database migration, seeding, etc.

# Code Flow

The entry point of the application is `main.js` located in the `/src` directory. This file bootstraps the application and starts the server. It also connects to the database and initializes all the microservices.

Each microservice is contained within its own directory in `/src`, and has its own routes, controllers, models, and services.

# Dependencies

The project has several dependencies, which are managed using npm. These include:

- `express`: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the web server.

- `mongoose`: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to manage relationships between data, provide schema validation, and translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

- `jest`: A testing framework for JavaScript, used to write and run tests.

- `dotenv`: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, used to manage environment variables.
