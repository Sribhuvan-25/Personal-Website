## Implementation Plan Summary
This implementation plan involves fixing a UI issue. The specific issue isn't mentioned, but the plan will involve identifying the problem, making the necessary changes in the relevant JavaScript, JSX, and CSS files, and then testing the solution.

## Steps Taken
1. {'step_1': {'description': 'Identify the specific UI issue that needs to be fixed.', 'action': 'This will involve communicating with the user or the person who reported the issue to understand the problem better.'}}
2. {'step_2': {'description': 'Locate the files that are likely to contain the source of the UI issue.', 'action': "These will likely be JavaScript, JSX, and CSS files. The 'workspace/Personal-Website/src/constants/index.js' file is a good starting point."}}
3. {'step_3': {'description': 'Modify the relevant files to fix the UI issue.', 'action': 'This will involve editing the code in the identified files to address the UI issue. This might involve changing JavaScript logic, JSX components, or CSS styles.'}}
4. {'step_4': {'description': 'Test the solution to ensure that the UI issue has been fixed.', 'action': 'This will involve running the application, navigating to the part of the UI that had the issue, and checking that the issue is no longer present.'}}
5. {'step_5': {'description': 'Commit and push the changes to the repository.', 'action': 'This will involve using git commands to add the changed files, commit the changes with a descriptive message, and push the changes to the remote repository.'}}
