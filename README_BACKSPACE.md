## Implementation Plan Summary
This implementation plan is to change the color of the LinkedIn icon to black in a personal website project.

## Steps Taken
1. {'step_1': "Identify the file where the LinkedIn icon is being used. It's most likely in one of the JSX files.", 'step_2': 'Once the file is identified, locate the SVG or image tag that represents the LinkedIn icon.', 'step_3': "If the icon is an SVG, modify the fill attribute to '#000000' which represents black. If it's an image, you'll need to replace it with a black version of the icon.", 'step_4': 'After making the changes, ensure to test them in different browsers to confirm the icon color change is reflecting properly.', 'step_5': 'Once tested, commit the changes with a meaningful commit message and push to the repository.'}
